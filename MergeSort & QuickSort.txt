 Merge Sort:
      1.Merge Sort is also based on divide and conquer approach to sort an array of elements.
 Quick Sort: 
         Quick Sort is faster.

      1.Quick sort algorithm follows the divide and conquer approach to sort an array of elements. 
      2.First it will choose the pivot element, pivot element is selected by the algorithm to proceed with the sorting.



Time Complexity of Quick Sort is O(n log n).
Merge Sort is more faster and efficient than quick sort when the array size is smaller.
And Quick Sort is more faster and efficient than merge sort when the array size is larger.


Advantages of Quick Sort:
1.Higher Efficiency.
2.Easy to implement.
Disadvantages of Quick Sort:
1.Worst Case Complexity.
Poor Pivot Selection.
